However, God of War 3 was originally released only for PlayStation 3 in 2010, and later remastered for PlayStation 4 in 2015. If you want to play this masterpiece on your PC, you will need to download and install it using a crack and a CD key. In this article, we will show you how to do that step by step.
 
## Step 1: Download God of War 3 Torrent File
 
The first thing you need to do is to download the torrent file of God of War 3 for PC. You can find it on various websites, such as Rob Gamers[^1^] or Console2PC[^2^]. Make sure you have a torrent client installed on your PC, such as uTorrent or BitTorrent. Then, open the torrent file and start downloading the game.
 
## Step 2: Mount or Burn the ISO File
 
Once the download is complete, you will have an ISO file of God of War 3 on your PC. This is a disc image file that contains all the data of the game. You can either mount it using a virtual drive software, such as Daemon Tools or PowerISO, or burn it to a DVD using a burning software, such as Nero or ImgBurn.
 
## Step 3: Install God of War 3 on Your PC
 
After mounting or burning the ISO file, you can start installing God of War 3 on your PC. To do that, open the disc drive where you mounted or inserted the ISO file, and run the setup.exe file. Follow the instructions on the screen and choose the destination folder where you want to install the game.
 
## Step 4: Copy the Crack Files to the Game Folder
 
The next step is to copy the crack files to the game folder. The crack files are usually located in a folder named Crack or SKIDROW inside the ISO file. You can either copy them manually or use an automatic installer that comes with some versions of the crack. The crack files will replace some original files of the game and allow you to bypass the copy protection.
 
## Step 5: Enter the CD Key When Prompted
 
The final step is to enter the CD key when prompted. The CD key is a unique code that activates the game and verifies that you have a legitimate copy. You can find the CD key on various websites, such as YouTube[^3^] or Google. Just type "Crack cd key god of war 3 pc download" in the search bar and you will see many results. Choose one that works for you and enter it when asked.
 
## Congratulations! You Have Successfully Installed God of War 3 on Your PC
 
Now you can enjoy playing God of War 3 on your PC with full graphics and performance. Experience the epic journey of Kratos as he fights his way through hordes of enemies, puzzles, and titans to reach his ultimate goal: killing Zeus, the king of the gods.
